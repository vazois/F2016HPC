Compilation & Execution Instructions

1) Type make to compile the code. Make sure to use gcc-4.7.2
2) To execute you can use the jobscript included on TARDIS.
3) To execute type ./dgemm -n=128 where n is the matrix size
4) All functions are executed so make sure to give small n unless you have time to spare :)
5) If you do make o3 it will let gcc optimize the code. It generally gives better results but i used no optimizations to run
the experiments
